TODO
====

###### This is just my little todo to take note of some stuff.

- Sanitize main.cpp a bit.
- Add building CIA files on the code itself.
- Prevent redownloads in the event one or more content files are found, preforming checks to decide either redownload is needed or not.
- Provide a fabricated CETK for content where we used an unique ticket instead of signed for all ticket to make output cias installable.
- Allow user to specify where they want downloads to go.
- Other stuff later.
